# IMPDB Access Migration

This directory is home to the tools that will migrate the Interim Mobility Project Database, an MS Access DB, into Moped.

The process is split into two steps.

1. Use Python to export all Access DB tables to JSON.
2. Use Javascript to transform and load the project data into Moped.

## Get it running

### Access DB Extraction

1. Download a snapshot of the Access DB from [Drive](https://drive.google.com/drive/u/2/folders/1-pNBTdfPBxJm8VpYjxpZwA8ziCLMZdRx). Save it as `./export_data/database/database.md`. These snapshots have been retrieved from G drive: ATD\ATD\Mobility Project Tracking

2. From this directory, build the docker image:

```shell
$ docker build -t moped-migra -t moped-migra:latest .
```

3. Run the export script by mounting this directory into the docker container:

```shell
$ docker run -it --rm -v "$(pwd)":/app moped-migra python export_data/export_data.py
```

4. Run the script that downloads facilities (aka components) spatial data from AGOL, as well as the canonical data sources we'll match against

```shell
$ docker run -it --rm -v "$(pwd)":/app moped-migra python export_data/get_facilities_geojson.py

$ docker run -it --rm -v "$(pwd)":/app moped-migra python export_data/get_ctn_segments_and_points_and_signals.py
```

### Transform and Load

1. Start the Hasura cluster and Moped Editor

```shell
# from atd-moped/moped-database
$ ./hasura-cluster start

# from atd-moped/moped-editor
$ nvm use
$ npm run start
```

2. Navigate to `./migrate_data` and install package dependencies:

```shell
# requires node v18
$ nvm use
# install packages
$ npm install
```

3. Prepare the geospatial data for import - this may take 5+ minutes

```shell
$ node facility_line_matcher.js
$ node facility_point_matcher.js
```

4. Run the migration!

```shell
$ node index.js local
```

5. Open the Moped Editor to inspect projects âœ¨


### On deck

- personnel
- milestones/date
- funding
- project types

### Issues to make / todo

- revisit mappings of transit - bus - stop since subcomponents have chagned :/
- there are facility spatial records with multiple features within one layer and across geom types.
- it does not seem possible edit users through the staff form in staging or prod :/
- add user matching to project `added_by`
- how to handle unmapped components?
  - create issue to allow unmapped components to be rendered and edited  (but not allow unmapped components to be saved)
- implement new subcomponents / split out work types
- physical protection type ("Protection Type"): can we move this to subcomponents?
- list view: render nothing instead of "12/31/1969" if the project has no modified date? or default the modified date?
- use a lookup table for note types
- check geometry types of components - some may need to be converted to point or line
- dedupe existing projects with interim_project_id
  - figure out how to handle these :/
- Data Requests


### NW Questions

- ability to edit component type of the same point/line type
- work authorizations statusID: default to....planned? complete?
- should we assign "New" work type to anything that doesn't have a work type?
- facility type "Corridor Plan" (and similalry the ProjecType) attribute - what to do with these? 
- the "Miscellaneous" facility type is usually referencing an SRTS id that we're not currently handling. There's also athe "Project Type" property that we're not handling"
- we are converting unmatched signals to intersection improvement components: review these with AMD
- how to handle entities that don't exist in moped. see https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1mRvElKNrswuWKga_I1iHSD4-5J9m4UsOuB8n5oyGvDs/edit#gid=1400142967
- some project descriptions missing

- not migrating these project facility colummns:
  - PerfMeasureCategory
  - PerfMeasureName
  - PerfMeasureType
  - Categories
