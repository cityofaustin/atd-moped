## Quick start

Welcome to the ðŸ›µ Moped codebase! Below is a step-by-step guide to help you get started by setting up the Moped environment.

### Prerequisites

Before you begin, make sure you have the following installed on your system:

- **Git**: To clone the repository.
- **Docker**: Moped uses Docker for container management.
- **Hasura CLI**: Required for managing the Hasura cluster.

### Setting Up Moped

1. **Install Hasura CLI**

   - Install the Hasura CLI by running the following command:

     ```bash
     curl -L <https://github.com/hasura/graphql-engine/raw/stable/cli/get.sh> | bash

     ```

   - Ensure it installs version `2.42.0` or later.

2. **Start the Hasura Cluster**

   - Navigate to the `moped-database` directory:

     ```bash
     cd moped-database

     ```

   - Start the Hasura cluster using Docker:

     ```bash
     ./hasura-cluster start

     ```

   - If you encounter errors related to migrations, you can try the following:

     ```bash
     ./hasura_cluster start_only
     ./run_migrations
     ./hasura-cluster start

     ```

3. **Run the Frontend React App**

   - Navigate to the `moped-editor` directory:

     ```bash
     cd moped-editor

     ```

   - Install the necessary npm packages:

     ```bash
     npm install

     ```

   - Start the frontend development server:

     ```bash
     npm start

     ```

   - The application should open in your browser at `https://localhost:3000/moped`.

### Troubleshooting

- **Logging in**: The SSO Button is expected to be disabled in the local environment. Use the external user sign-in option instead and request test credentials from a team member.
