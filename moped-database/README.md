# MOPED Database

You will want to check the documentation in the [MOPED Technical Docs](https://app.gitbook.com/@atd-dts/s/moped-technical-docs/dev-guides/hasura-migrations)

## Architecture Description

Broadly, the Moped application uses a backend [PostgreSQL](https://www.postgresql.org/) database server which is protected from the larger internet on a private subnet. An instance of [Hasura](https://hasura.io/)'s [graphql-engine](https://github.com/hasura/graphql-engine) is used as middleware exposing a graphql endpoint for use by the application running on a client's computer. The `graphql-engine` instance is provided by [the official docker images](https://hub.docker.com/r/hasura/graphql-engine) provided by hasura on DockerHub. 

### `graphql-engine` update plan

The update schedule for Moped's `graphql-engine` deployment is as follows:

* The deployment's ECS service should be updated to the latest, odd minor release available.

The intent is to stay generally up-to-date, but avoid `.0` releases and to maintain a sustainable update cadence. 

## Getting Started

#### 1. Install Docker & Docker Compose

You will want to follow the docker documentation on how to install docker in your system.

For Mac: https://docs.docker.com/docker-for-mac/install/

For Windows: https://docs.docker.com/docker-for-windows/install/

#### 2. Install the Hasura CLI

In your Terminal, run the following command:

```
curl -L https://github.com/hasura/graphql-engine/raw/stable/cli/get.sh | bash
```

This will install the Hasura CLI in /usr/local/bin. You might have to provide your sudo password depending on the permissions of your /usr/local/bin location.

If youâ€™d prefer to install to a different location other than /usr/local/bin, set the env var INSTALL_PATH:

```
curl -L https://github.com/hasura/graphql-engine/raw/stable/cli/get.sh | INSTALL_PATH=$HOME/bin bash
```

There is another way to install Hasura via npm, but if you managed to install with the steps above you already have the super-powers you need to start working with migrations.

**Installation - Windows:** Download the binary cli-hasura-windows-amd64.exe available under Assets of the latest release from the GitHub release page: https://github.com/hasura/graphql-engine/releases
Rename the downloaded file to hasura. You can add the path to the environment variable PATH for making hasura accessible globally.

For more info, refer to their documentation:
https://hasura.io/docs/1.0/graphql/core/hasura-cli/install-hasura-cli.html

#### 3. The Hasura Cluster Helper

There is a tool we've created that has a few shortcuts available, it's called [hasura-cluster](https://github.com/cityofaustin/atd-moped/blob/main/moped-database/hasura-cluster).
This just a bash script that runs a few docker-compose commands.

Syntax:

```
$ ./hasura-cluster <command> <params>
```

[1] Set your environment:
```
$ ./hasura-cluster setenv local
```

[2] Start the cluster:

```
$ ./hasura-cluster start
```

[3] Start the hasura console (press Ctrl+C to stop)

```bash
$ ./hasura-cluster console
# - or -
$ hasura console
```

[4] Stop the cluster (whenever you are finished):

```
$ ./hasura-cluster stop
```

### Hasura-Cluster Cloning & Restoring

There may be occasions where you need to copy the data in staging or production to run it locally. Clone and restore allow for these operations to happen easily.

#### I. Configure

You will first need to configure your environment:

Example:

1. Copy the hasura_cluster template file into your ssh directory with this specific name:

   `$ cp config/hasura_cluster_template.json ~/.ssh/hasura_cluster.json`;

   Note: This script expects to find it with this name `~/.ssh/hasura_cluster.json`

2. Change permissions so only you can read/write to it:

   `chmod 600 ~/.ssh/hasura_cluster.json`

3. Edit the file with nano or vim, and fill-in the blanks:

   `nano ~/.ssh/hasura_cluster.json`

   -or-

   `vim ~/.ssh/hasura_cluster.json`

4. Save and exit

#### II. Clone

Cloning basically runs pg_dump for you and saves the file into the snapshots directory. To do this, you run:

This operation does not insert into your local database.

Syntax:

```bash
$./hasura-cluster clone [environment]
```

Example:

- Cloning staging or production:

```bash
./hasura-cluster clone staging
./hasura-cluster clone production
```


- Cloning a staging or production backup from S3:

```bash
./hasura-cluster clone bucket staging "2021-11-03"
./hasura-cluster clone bucket production "2021-11-03"
```



#### III. Restore

This operation loads a snapshot into your local database instance. It does not create a snapshot.

- Listing snapshot files downloaded:

```bash
./hasura-cluster list local [staging|production]
```

- Listing files in an s3 bucket:

```bash
./hasura-cluster list bucket [staging|production]
```

- Restoring a specific file:

```bash
./hasura-cluster restore [filename]
```

NOTE: If hasura isn't running, restore is going to exit with an error.

- Restarting the hasura cluster without migrations:

```bash
./hasura-cluster reload
```
### Hasura-Cluster Reference

- `run_migration`: Runs all 3 hasura migrations: database, metadata, seed data. 
- `start_only`: Starts the cluster and does NOT run migrations.
- `start`: Starts the cluster and runs all migrations.
- `stop`: Stops the cluster, removes any volumes left out.
- `prune`: Deletes any volumes left out by the cluster. 
- `follow`: Shows the logs for the running cluster.
- `status`: Displays the current status of the cluster
- `setenv`: Changes the current environment.

#### Hasura-Cluster SetEnv: 

What `setenv` really does is to copy an existing file from the ./config folder into
the current folder and renames it into `config.yaml`. The `hasura` command (CLI) will
read its settings from `config.yaml`.

For example, there should only be a file in the ./config folder called `hasura.local.yaml`
which contains the connection information for the local cluster. Notice the format
`hasura.<environment>.yaml`. If for example, you need to connect the Hasura Staging cluster, 
you would need to create a new file called `hasura.staging.yaml`, provide all the info, 
then run `$ hasura-cluster setenv staging` and `hasura console`.

### Database Migrations

#### Views

To version control database views, SQL files are stored in `/views/` and the steps to modify a view and create a migration are available [here](/views/README.md).
