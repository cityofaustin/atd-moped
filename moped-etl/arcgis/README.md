Scripts which integrate Moped data with Esri ArcGIS

## Publish components to ArcGIS Online (AGOL)

The script `components_to_agol.py` is used to publish component record data to ArcGIS Online (AGOL). It replaces all records in the AGOL feature services with the latest component data in Moped.

The data is sourced from a view, `component_arcgis_online_view` which defines all columns which are available to be processed.

The AGOL layers can be found here:

- [Project component points](https://austin.maps.arcgis.com/home/item.html?id=997555f6e0904aa88eafe73f19ee65c0)
- [Project component lines](https://austin.maps.arcgis.com/home/item.html?id=e8f03d2cec154cacae539b630bcaa70b)

### Get it running

1. Configure an `env_file` according to the `env_template` example. You can find the AGOL Scripts Publisher username and password in the API Secrets vault in the team password store.

2. Create and activate a Python environment that meets the requirments in `requirements.txt`. Alternatively, you can use the provided Dockerfile.
