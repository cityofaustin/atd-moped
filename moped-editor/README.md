Web application for interacting with Moped data.

## Quick start

1. Clone this repo. Start new branches from `main`.

2. Follow [steps](https://github.com/cityofaustin/atd-moped/tree/main/moped-database#readme) to start the Moped database.

3. We use [Node Version Manager](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm) (nvm) to keep our `node` versions in sync with our environments. With `nvm` installed, run `nvm use` from this directory to activate the current `node` and `npm` version required for this project. If you don't want to use `nvm`, refer to the `.nvmrc` file for the `node` version you should install.
